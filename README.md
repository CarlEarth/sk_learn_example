# sk_learn_example
There are some machine-learning examples for sk-learn.

a. KNN and SVC for digits data.
b. KNN for iris data

In these examples, we can learn:

1. The data structure and how to split it for using.
2. Train model with data. After training, save and call in another code.
3. Use cross-validation to score the model with different value of model parameter.
4. Seeing the learning curve.

Here, really thanks to the Mofan. python tutorial: https://morvanzhou.github.io/
I write these codes for practice when I learn sk-learn for this website.  
If you are interested in this, I recommend you to watch his tutorial video. (Language: Chinese)
